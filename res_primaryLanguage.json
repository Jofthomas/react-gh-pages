I grew up in the south west of France and work brought me to differents places like belgium or San Francisco. Passionate about computer science, it enables me to bring my creativity and my ideas to life. Ai models can sometime be impressive but not very interractive, hence, I chose to play with models that are very visual for the user. I hope you can have fun on this website ! üïπÔ∏è.",
